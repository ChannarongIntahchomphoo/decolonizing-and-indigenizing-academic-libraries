AB  - The need to manage indigenous knowledge (IK) as a key knowledge base of society has become vital in the era of information society. The lack of representation of IK is partly blamed on its exclusion from academia because IK is not primarily the core focus of academic library's collection. The study sought to explore existing models and develop a framework for the management of indigenous knowledge in academic libraries in Ghana. The qualitative methodology using content analysis was adopted for the purpose of the study. Data was analysed using themes developed from the documents and literature. It was evident that the library services and programmes did not reflect on the African content of knowledge management. For an integrated indigenous knowledge management system, stakeholder's partnership, policy guidelines and integration of IK into library's collection is instrumental. Transformation of knowledge systems was identified as the starting point of integration. Social inclusion of marginalised knowledge, equality, sustainable development was identified and recommended in the effort to integrate indigenous knowledge management systems into the library's collection. A proposed framework has been developed for the management of indigenous knowledge in academic libraries as a blueprint for any integration effort. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: University intellectual output such as theses and dissertations are valuable resources containing rigorous research results. Library staff who are key players in promoting intellectual output through institutional repositories require skills to promote content visibility, create wider outreach and facilitate easy access and use of these resources. This study aims to determine the skills of library staff to enhance the visibility of intellectual output in federal university libraries in southeast Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: A survey research design was adopted for the study. The questionnaire was used to obtain responses from library staff on the extent of computer skills and their abilities for digital conversion, metadata creation and preservation of digital content. Findings: Library staff at the university libraries had high skills in basic computer operations. They had moderate skills in digital conversion, preservation and storage. However, they had low skills in metadata creation. Practical implications: The study has implications for addressing the digital skills and professional expertise of library staff, especially as it concerns metadata creation, digital conversion, preservation and storage. It also has implications for the university management to prioritize the training of their library staff in other to increase the visibility of indigenous resources and university Web ranking. Originality/value: This study serves as a lens to identify library staff skill gaps in many critical areas that require expertise and stimulate conscious effort toward developing adequate skills for effective digital information provision. It sheds light on the challenges that many Nigerian university libraries face in their pursuit of global visibility and university Web ranking. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This qualitative research study explores the ways that academic librarians in England undertake and perceive classification and cataloging work to engage in wider decolonization initiatives. The research consisted of semi-structured interviews, and thematic analysis was used to identify key themes. The study found that the participant librarians highly value this work based on a perception of its moral importance, rather than concrete proof of impact. Benefits from a decolonization perspective were not always clear. Challenges include staffing shortages and technological limitations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T1  - Representational work and 'reverse order' essentialism: Digitisation of local information in Thailand and Bhabha's Third Space.

AB  - The Local Information Working Group (LIWG) of Thailand's provincial university libraries holds main responsibility for digitising Thai local information (LI), a resource that shares many characteristics with what in other contexts is described as Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK). This study therefore explores how the digitisation activities of the LIWG correlate with claims of culturally responsive and responsible ILK representation, and how this work can be understood through the perspective of Bhabha's Third Space. The study is based on interviews with 23 LIWG members, collected in 2016–2017. A guided, qualitative content analysis focused on uncovering themes of digitisation tools and methods with Third Space relevance as supporting or hindering essentialism, fixity and hybridity in LI representations. The findings illustrate that whereas the digitisation itself, field studies, language choices and outreach activities offer certain Third Space potential, this is underdeveloped and largely circumstantial. Third Space potentials are further likely to be restricted or hindered by uneven distribution of internet access, digital literacy, standard Thai proficiency and university/academic library accessibility among the Thai public in general and LI holders in particular. Overall, marginalised groups are excluded, and LI holders are positioned as passive contributors and recipients of digitised LI, suggesting a reversed sort of 'self-essentialism' on behalf of the dominant culture. In conclusion, two aspects in particular require further attention for libraries engaging with digitisation of ILK types of resources: the inclusion of national, societal level participation into participatory approaches; and the incorporation of functionalities for user interaction, holistic knowledge representation, multiple languages and cultural protocols into ICT for representation and use. The study provides a unique application of Third Space as analytical perspective on library digitisation of LI/ILK types of resources. Methodologically, the study is case specific, limited to a cross-section in time, and to data from interview accounts of LIWG members. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This Regular Feature is based on a PhD study assessing the level of health literacy among university students in Pakistan. A cross‐sectional survey was carried out using the validated European Health Literacy Survey (HLS‐EU‐Q) and non‐parametric tests used to analyse data with the aim of determining the influence of personal determinants on health literacy skills. The findings of the study concluded that the population had a low health literacy level with limited skills in accessing, understanding, appraising and applying information for health care. Gender, age, and native languages, all had a statistically significant influence on health literacy skills. Practical implications are presented for the role of university libraries in supporting the development of health literacy in their undergraduate student populations are presented, including the need for the provision of health information in native languages.

AB  - Local information (LI) in Thailand covers resources related to Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK), and cultural heritage. Thailand's provincial universities have the national responsibility of digitising LI, enforced through the Provincial University Library Network's (PULINET's) Local Information Working Group (LIWG). The aim of this study is to explore how the LIWG's digitisation activities contribute to the shaping of LI as national concern and resource. Empirical data come from interviews with 23 LIWG professionals in 2016–2017. A qualitative content analysis is performed within an overall activity theory framework with emphasis on overt and unobtrosive manifestations of contradictions through a combination of Engeström's and Blackler's typologies. The results show that primary contradictions exist in the form of incompatible conceptions of LI between individual group members and the group's consensus-oriented LI definition. Secondary contradictions emerge as incongruences between group members' general conceptions of LI, and specific digitisation activities of the LIWG. In general, LI is conceptualised as dynamic, situated, collective, culture-nature integrated resources with strong applied-use value, in line with international ILK definitions and agendas. The actual LIWG activities, however, circumscribe this conception through a restricted focus on formal regional delimitations; prominent objects; societally desirable expressions; and an academic/research framing. Overall, the findings illustrate that the LIWG's activities contribute to shape LI as a tool for national social and cultural unity that exclude marginalised groups and societally undesirable LI expressions. In these activities, the primary and secondary types of contradictions are hidden and counteracted, rather than used as constructive opportunities for learning, change, and development. The study provides a unique, internationally framed, perspective on LI and related digitisation activities in Thailand. Methodologically, the study is case specific, limited to a cross-section in time and to data from interview accounts of LIWG members. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper is to examine the role academic libraries can play to organize and make indigenous knowledge accessible for national development. The target audience for the paper are academic librarians in Ghana, researchers of African studies in Ghana and other stakeholders. This is a qualitative study with data from interviews with the librarians and a desk-top literature review. Academic librarians in Ghana recognize the importance of indigenous knowledge organization, but little has been done by way of research. Most academic libraries in Ghana have the basic resources to manage indigenous knowledge. Academic librarians need to be proactive in their collaborative efforts to manage indigenous knowledge. Academic librarians in Ghana should be proactive towards effective management of indigenous knowledge, for easy accessibility. Again, academic libraries need to be well resourced to manage indigenous knowledge. Finally, academic libraries need to create awareness about the importance of indigenous knowledge using different media platforms to all stakeholders. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Indigenous or traditional knowledge (IK) holders face a lack of respect and appreciation for such knowledge. Respect for culture means following protocols, accepting diversity and recognizing indigenous cultures as living and continuously evolving. This is a 'hot topic', and the central goal of this article is to advance understandings to allow cultural memory institutions (libraries, archives and museums) to respect, affirm and recognize indigenous ownership of their traditional and living indigenous knowledges and to respect the protocols for their use. The various ways of managing and preserving indigenous knowledge, especially using new technologies in the digital era, will be explored and ideas on how to respect the indigenous culture, even in the process of documenting or preserving in academic libraries, will be outlined. Libraries involved in IK preservation will be encouraged to develop protocols by collaborating with each other and engaging the community, to preserve each unique culture in a respectful manner. Intellectual property rights of knowledge holders, respect for these rights and procedures to adopt will be described. Activities undertaken to preserve indigenous knowledge are assessed and suggestions made on how library and information science professionals could more efficiently handle indigenous knowledge preservation as respect for culture.

AB  - Finding data on race, racialized populations, and anti-racism in Canada can be a complex process when conducting research. One source of data is the Census of Canada which has been collecting sociodemographic data since 1871. However, the collection of racial, ethnic, or Indigenous data has changed throughout the years and from Census to Census. In response to the need for more support in finding ethno-racial and Indigenous data, the Ontario Council of University Libraries' Ontario Data Community has created an online guide to provide guidance, in part, about the terminology used for Indigenous and racialized identities over time in the Census. In this article, the modifications to how ethno-racial origin questions have been asked, and the ongoing changes to sociocultural perceptions impacting the Census are reviewed.

AB  - Objective - To explore what library organizational factors influence library staff morale. Design - Semi-structured interview, grounded theory. Setting - Academic libraries across the United States during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects - 34 academic library staff, defined by the authors as employees whose positions do not require an MLIS degree and do not include the title "librarian", from 23 private and public colleges and universities across 16 states, mostly representative of the West and Midwest regions. Methods - In 2020, the authors emailed a call for study participants to library listservs and state library associations across the US, selected a convenience sample of 34 library staff from academic institutions, and conducted structured interviews by phone or by Google Meet over the course of May through June 2020. The authors note that the sample over-represents public and larger institutions in the West and Midwest regions. A student worker transcribed the audio recordings and de-identified transcripts underwent iterative, thematic coding in MAXQDA, a qualitative data analysis tool. The authors used a grounded theory approach to conduct open coding, then identified relationships between themes, and elaborated upon each theme based on its relationship to a theoretical model of morale impact avenues in library organizational structures, which was developed by one of the authors. Main Results-The authors uncovered that most study participants (n = 21) reported having high levels of morale, a surprise to the research team who expected that participants with lower levels of morale would participate in the study. Most participants (n = 27) worked in public and larger institutions, and the majority were female (n = 24), though only 5 were Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Participants mostly had MLIS degrees or other advanced degrees. The results of the study expanded beyond the original research questions to comprise a broader set of factors that impact morale levels including relationships with colleagues and direct managers, opportunities for advancement, respect, work autonomy, and funding. Respondents emphasized that staff morale was significantly impacted by their relationship with direct managers, noting that micromanagement, defensiveness, and lack of accommodations contributed to lower levels of morale and a sense of disconnection. Managers who were supportive, advocated for staff needs, and were good listeners improved morale. Relationships between staff and their librarian colleagues also impacted morale, with the librarian-staff divide and treatment of staff by librarians being major contributors to influencing morale. Additionally, staff felt that having or lacking respect from librarians and administration and having autonomy and flexibility in their work made a big impact on morale. Having opportunities to meaningfully engage, to advance in the workplace, to receive professional development funding, to participate in decision-making processes, and to feel valued by the institution contributed to higher levels of staff morale. Conclusion - Library staff morale is impacted mostly by staff members' sense of connection, respect, and value within the institution and among their librarian colleagues, direct managers, and library administration. Having pathways for advancement and professional development, meaningful opportunities to contribute to institutional decision-making, and autonomy over their professional and personal lives contributed to a higher sense of staff morale. The authors highlight several practical recommendations for improving staff morale including fostering a respectful environment, advocating for more flexible and better work environments, and providing opportunities for professional development and growth.

AB  - In the past seven years, student-led decolonisation movements have taken root in UK universities. Decolonising the university is an intellectual project, asking critical questions about the content of curricula, disciplinary canons and pedagogical approaches. It is simultaneously a material one, challenging the colonial legacies that manifest in institutional spaces, cultures and financial decisions, students' experience and staff labour conditions (Cotton, 2018, p. 24). Academic libraries have recognised their role in addressing how 'coloniality survives colonialism' (Maldonado-Torres, 2007, p. 243), in particular through the diversification of collections and resources. However, libraries have neglected to interrogate their educational potential for decolonisation, specifically in exercising information literacy (IL) teaching and approaches. This qualitative research examines IL through a decolonial lens with an eye to both its colonial attributes and its potential for decolonising the curriculum. Interviews with five academic researchers are used to explore the potential for critical information literacy (CIL) in decolonial work and ask what IL might look like from a decolonial perspective. The findings of the interviews are structured according to Icaza and Vázquez's framework of three core processes for decolonising the university; they reveal that CIL might usefully facilitate positionality, practice relationality and consider transitionality. In turn, these findings lead to a set of recommendations for unsettling IL and generating the potential for decolonisation. The relationship between CIL and decolonising the curriculum is as yet unexplored and academics' engagement with and opinions on CIL have rarely been examined. This research therefore offers some novel contributions for IL practitioners and researchers in relation to both teaching/learning and research. It also contributes some points of departure for a more a powerful and holistic decolonial pedagogy in the university. A more fitting approach than traditional IL, critical information literacy can become a key part of scaffolding a decolonising approach to learners' navigation of information and processes of knowing.

AB  - This article discusses the role of the academic library in contributing to the reconciliation process in Australia through the lens of James Cook University. Reconciliation in this context is defined as the process to bring together Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian peoples to overcome the gap that exists between them. Two of James Cook University's campuses are located in North Queensland, an area with a high Indigenous population. It has in place a Reconciliation Action Plan and Statement of Strategic Intent, which provide a clear statement supporting its Indigenous students and staff. This article focuses on the participation of James Cook University Library and Information Service in the university's reconciliation goals through four broad areas of interest: procurement, engagement, staffing, and information literacy training. Of particular note is the naming of the Townsville Campus library – the Eddie Koiki Mabo Library – in recognition of Mabo's connection with James Cook University, marking the significance of the role this Indigenous man played in Australia's history.

AB  - Purpose: In September 2015 protests erupted at the University of Missouri following a series of racist incidents on campus and culminating in the resignation of the university president in November 2015. In solidarity with the protests student activists at universities across the United States and Canada organized into the Black Liberation Collective and held the first #StudentBlackoutOut day of protests on university campuses on November 15 followed by the publication of lists of demands to over 80 colleges in 28 states, the District of Columbia and Canada in the hopes of creating more-equitable and inclusive institutions. These demands shared similarity in requests for equity as those put forth during the Black Campus Movement of the late 1960s which led to the establishment of Black studies and cultural centers at colleges and universities. Academic libraries in particular were included with several demands to better serve the Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) community. Design/methodology/approach: While librarianship has largely been a historically White profession, libraries have undertaken many diversity and inclusion initiatives over the years. This article will examine seven case studies concerning college and university libraries addressing demands collated by the Black Liberation Collective in 2015. Six years out from the publication of the lists, we will evaluate statements issued by the libraries and posted on their websites, the promises that have been made to address inequities and the ensuing actions the libraries have taken to create a welcoming, inclusive community. Findings: The authors examine seven institutions where demands from student activists speak directly to the library. We examine the library's response to make changes and subsequent actions. Originality/value: The authors take a journalist approach to their research and examination of library responses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Native Americans are underrepresented in higher education; and, while considerable research examines Native student persistence, the role of academic libraries in their experiences has received little attention. This study proposes to investigate Native American undergraduate students' library experiences, needs, and perceptions. Qualitative interviews explored Native student perspectives on library services, space, and culture. Findings suggest that core library services are important to Native students, that visible representation of Native Americans contributes to a sense of belonging, and that Native student identity has varied significance for library use. This study has implications for librarians seeking to improve services for Native students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Canada is at an interesting point in its history, where the atrocious assimilation practices that were in place until the mid-1990s are being acknowledged in the hopes for a better relationship between Canada's Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. Both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, and the Canadian Federation of Library Associations/Federation Canadienne des Associations de Bibliotheques (CFLA/FCAB)'s report from its Truth and Reconciliation Committee (n.d.) recognize the significant role of education needed to address changes. Where do academic libraries fit into this? I first discuss the colonial history of libraries, as extensions of education institutions, followed by a look at how library and information science (LIS) curriculum falls short in preparing students for working with Indigenous peoples and Indigenous resources. Finally, I examine how libraries can decolonize their services. Canadian academic library staff cannot continue to be so ill-equipped to serve Indigenous students and faculty. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In response to the rapid growth of international students in China's universities, it is important for university libraries to extend their existing services, which were mainly designed for native Chinese students. This paper reports on a research study aimed at extending library services for international students by identifying and understanding their requirements. An exploratory case study research design was adopted. Specifically, the Wuhan University Library was selected as the case study, at which 23 international students were approached and interviewed using semi-structured questions. The analysis of interview data pointed to 14 library service requirements in four main themes: feeling welcomed, convenient accessibility, comfortable learning environment and diverse learning resources. On this basis, five practical strategies were formulated. This study focused on China's university libraries, however, the research findings provide useful implications and insights that can be shared across international borders. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: Entrepreneurship is being seen as a core driver of economic revival. Consequently, organizations and institutions, including universities, are being called upon to accelerate their role in an increasingly entrepreneurial environment. The sub-streams of entrepreneurship are manifold; yet, there is still the notion that entrepreneurship is solely about making profits. Within this context there are questions, within and without librarianship, regarding whether a library, which is a non-profit entity, can be an entrepreneur. As such, this paper purposed to examine the extent to which the terms library and entrepreneurship harmonise, through a case study of a large Caribbean university library, with the objective of highlighting practice, possibilities and lessons. Design/Methodology: Employees of the understudy library were purposively sampled and surveyed. Findings: The theo-practical lens through which one views entrepreneurship, determine perceptions regarding the status of the understudy library as an entrepreneur. Research Limitations/Implications: This paper examined one of the largest indigenous university library in the English-speaking Caribbean; it is possible that the situation for other types/sizes of Caribbean university libraries may vary. Therefore, it would be useful to study other Caribbean university libraries. Originality/Value: This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on "libraries and entrepreneurship" and evidence for "value of libraries" albeit from a Caribbean perspective. It also highlights the status of entrepreneurship in libraries in general, and a Caribbean university library in particular, and in this regard offers a case for strengthening entrepreneurship in other Caribbean university libraries. Additionally, it is the first scholarly paper on Caribbean university library entrepreneurship. Practical & Social Implications: There is a gap in the literature on practical examples and scholarly papers on building a Caribbean entrepreneurial university library. Using the response of the understudy Caribbean university library, this paper seeks to fill this gap, albeit incrementally, through proposing a broad "Entrepreneurial University Library Framework for building an entrepreneurial university library within the context of the Caribbean. Although this study was conducted within a Caribbean context, hence the phrase entrepreneurial Caribbean university library, its model can be used by other comparable institutions worldwide, struggling with increasing demands to be entrepreneurial.

AB  - As common resources in academic libraries, research guides can be expected to furnish researchers and students with access to resources on topics taught at their institution. In the law school libraries of institutions with significant programming on topics in Jewish Studies, Islamic Studies, or Indigenous Studies, librarians must be prepared to provide or facilitate access to materials addressing such topics, as well as instruct in their use. However, many Canadian law school libraries currently do not provide adequate support in this area. I argue that libraries at schools where courses or programs address these topics have a responsibility to support them through research guides. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Dans les bibliothèques des facultés de droit des établissements qui offrent une programmation importante sur des sujets comme les études juives, les études islamiques ou les études autochtones, les bibliothécaires doivent être prêts à fournir ou à faciliter l’accès aux documents qui traitent de ces sujets, ainsi qu’à donner des instructions sur leur utilisation. Cependant, de nombreuses bibliothèques d’écoles de droit canadiennes ne fournissent pas actuellement un soutien adéquat dans ce domaine. Je soutiens que les bibliothèques des écoles où les cours ou les programmes abordent ces sujets ont la responsabilité de les soutenir par le biais de guides de recherche.

AB  - By authorizing outdated terms for North American Indigenous peoples, the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) vocabulary deprioritizes or ignores the preferred names of the peoples being described. As a result, cataloging and metadata professionals constrained by LCSH often must apply names imposed during colonization. For example, in many library catalogs, works about people of the Meskwaki Nation in Iowa are labeled with “Fox Indians--Iowa” and “Sauk Indians--Iowa,” and Ioway peoples are described as “Iowa Indians.” As part of a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative at Iowa State University Library, a working group in the Metadata Services department undertook a project to build, publish, and use a controlled vocabulary of preferred terms for Indigenous communities with ties to land that is now part of the state of Iowa. This paper describes the working group’s research, outreach efforts, published vocabulary, and process for adding the preferred subject headings to library metadata. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article sheds light upon an important though widely forgotten episode of Russian American history, illustrating the efforts of prominent Russian statesman, Count Sergei Witte, to educate Americans about his native land. While touring Columbia University in the summer of 1905 and discovering the absence of documents and works relating to Russian economic and social conditions in its library, Witte ordered various Russian governmental agencies to arrange for collections of their most important publications to be shipped there. Matching previously unpublished archival materials in the Russian State Historical Archive (RGIA) with corresponding records at Columbia made it possible to illuminate the generous imperial gift of thousands of volumes of official publications, which became the foundation of the Slavic section of Columbia University Library. The article also touches upon the role of prominent members of the Columbia University Board of Trustees in welcoming Count Witte and expands on Warburg's donation that allowed Columbia to subscribe to many important papers and purchase books and pamphlets relating to the first Russian revolution.

T1  - Generation 1.5 and Academic Libraries: Strategies for Supporting English Learners (ELs) in Reference and Instruction.

AB  - Background - Compared to native English speakers, English Learners (ELs) often face additional barriers to academic success. Though typically competent in social English, Generation 1.5 ELs struggle with academic English at the postsecondary level and are still considered to be in the process of learning English. As colleges become increasingly linguistically diverse, academic librarians must adapt to support the growing numbers of ELs in the campus community. Objective - This paper aims to provide academic librarians with information on the scope of English Learners in K-12 through postsecondary education, academic challenges of Generation 1.5 students at the postsecondary level, and strategies that librarians can employ to support English learners in the contexts of reference and instruction. Methods - The author searched journals in the disciplines of academic libraries, higher education, Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), and linguistics. Additional resources searched include education data and statistics, research institute publications, and English as a New Language (ENL) teaching resources. These sources were explored in regard to the topics of EL educational statistics, K-12 ENL programs, ENL pedagogy, ELs in postsecondary education, Generation 1.5 students, ELs' academic challenges and Results - A review of the literature on ELs in academic libraries, particularly Generation 1.5 students, reveals that Generation 1.5 is a population that is in need of support at the postsecondary level. Because Generation 1.5 students often hold strong social English skills, they may enter college without an EL designation or specialized academic support. However, research shows that Generation 1.5 students struggle with college-level academic English, specifically in grammar and vocabulary. These challenges impact students' communicative success both in college classroom and library environments. Conclusion - Academic librarians may adopt pedagogical strategies commonly employed in ENL classrooms to use in reference and instruction environments. Techniques include themes such as awareness of language use and reinforcement of content, and require low-stakes implementation into library practice. Though librarians may be unaware of the language learning needs of their students, such strategies have shown to be useful for all students. Because techniques that are helpful to ELs also typically benefit all students, these strategies are also applicable to native English speakers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aim: The paper examined the university library in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and the preconditions for achieving and sustaining the same in Nigeria. 4IR is characterized by a level of automation, deployment of emerging technologies and artificial intelligence, internet connectivity and accessibility to the global information network, subscription to reputable online databases, quality and comprehensive collection in diverse formats, preponderance of digital natives among patrons, increased demand for seamless access to online resources and virtual operations, new library spaces (learning commons, research commons and makerspace), open scholarly communication, research data management, social mediation applications, digital curation and preservation. The challenges militating against effective crystallization of 4IR university libraries include: financial constraints, inad- equate infrastructure, resistance to change, inadequate skills and competencies, security and intrusion issues, lack of exposure to international standards. Conclusions: The paper recommended the following as requisite panacea: leadership, demonstrating and justifying returns on investment, benchmarking practices, anti-intrusion and back-up systems, adequate power supply and bandwidth, endowment and corporate social responsibility, indigenous library management software, and capacity building initiatives. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Die Revolution ist gekennzeichnet durch das Niveau der Automatisierung, die Einführung neuer Technologien und der künstlichen Intelligenz, den Zugang zum Internet und die Zugänglichkeit des globalen Informationsnetzes, die Subskription renommierter Internetdatenbanken, die Qualität und die komplexe Sammlung in verschiedenen Formaten, die als dominierende Kunden betrachtete Generation des digitalen Zeitalters, die erhöhte Nachfrage nach problemlosem Zugang zu Online-Ressourcen und virtuellen Operationen, neue Bibliotheksräume (gemeinsames Lernen, Untersuchen und schöpferischer Raum), die offene wissenschaftliche Kommunikation, das Forschungsdatenmanagement, die Applikationen der Sozialmedien, die digitale Wiedergewinnung und Sicherstellung. Zu den Herausforderungen, die sich der effektiven Kristallisierung der Universitätsbibliotheken während der Revolution widersetzen, gehören: Finanzeinschränkungen, eine ungeeignete Infrastruktur, der Widerstand gegen Veränderungen, unzureichende Fähigkeiten und Kompetenzen, Sicherheits- und Einbruchsprobleme, die mangelnde Kenntnis internationaler Standards. Schlussfolgerung: Der Beitrag schlägt folgendes vor: das Leadership, die Festlegung und Begründung des Return on Investment, Vergleichspraktiken, Einbruchs- und Sicherungssysteme, eine angemessene Stromversorgung und Kapazität, die Ausrüstung und soziale Verantwortung des Unternehmens, native Bibliotheksverwaltungssoftware und Initiativen zum Potentialaufbau.

AB  - Vernacular language videos with narration in non-English languages have been used in North American academic libraries to engage and empower international and non-native English-speaking students. This study investigated the effectiveness of McGill University Library's orientation videos from the perspective of these students, using mixed methods to outline student learning, affective responses, and views on audiovisual features used in the video. Compared to the English video, vernacular language videos are equally effective in delivering content and more adept at invoking student enthusiasm about the library. These students' perceptions on video design and audiovisual features are useful for librarians who use videos to engage a linguistically diverse campus. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - As the Soviet Union and its challenge to the West recede, we still have much to learn about the Slavic book trade and about the rise of the great Russian, East European, and Eurasian area studies collections in academic libraries in 20th-century North America. Who were the book dealers behind these collections, which still inform so much discovery and knowledge-making today? What can we learn about these personalities and their work? One such book dealer was George Sabo (1896–1983), who followed two brothers to Pittsburgh in 1913 but made his career in New York after 1920, first with a "steamship agency" for fellow immigrants. As a Carpatho-Rusyn from the Kingdom of Hungary, Sabo took his outlook and cultural capital from an ethno-religious group at the very center of the Slavic world and in remarkable symbiosis with nearly all its peoples, languages, identities, and states. Sabo's native village (Orechová) became part of Czechoslovakia after World War I and his wife's (Haidosh) part of the Soviet Union after World War II. Sabo's Carpatho-Rusyn-ness equipped him well as a Slavic-American book dealer and enterprising New Yorker, and we can illuminate much of his life, family, network, surroundings, and career in the city and beyond from many kinds of sources.

AB  - In this article, Ms Yihang Chen with her supervisor, Prof Lihong Zhou, reports on her MA in Library Science study aimed to identify user requirements of library research support services (RSS) at the universities of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in China. This study adopted an inductive qualitative approach, employed as a case study and 14 TCM researchers and academic librarians using semi‐structured interviews. The research findings point to 28 RSS requirements in five main themes: mastering, planning, project, publication and electronic preservation stages. Although this research is situated in China, it has implications for libraries worldwide in supporting research into holistic and indigenous medicine. F.J. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Academic libraries serving education students have an obligation to provide exceptional offerings of current, decolonized, diverse, and inclusive children's literature, while also providing examples of historical juvenile writings to critique and compare. The first step is to update the juvenile collection policy to reflect decolonized changes by determining guidelines and parameters for which books stay in a collection, which will be removed, and which books will be moved to a "historical texts" collection. The policy should also reflect a more inclusive collation for new acquisitions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The revitalization of Latin American Indigenous languages started many years ago, but only some university libraries in the United States have taken steps to advocate for preservation, access, inclusion, and diversity through collection building covering these languages and cultures. This study examines holdings of Quechua, Nahuatl, Guaraní, Zapotec, Maya, Mapudungun, and Aymara materials in 87 university libraries in the United States. This study seeks to answer the question: are university libraries in the United States supporting inclusion and diversity through the purchase of Latin American Indigenous language materials? In addition, the author explores what initiatives university libraries could take to further the revitalization and advancement of these Indigenous languages. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article describes a collections survey project undertaken by the staff of the University Libraries' Special Collections and University Archives Department at the University of Nevada, Reno, to begin the archives' alignment with the Protocols for Native American Archival Materials. The method devised to survey the collection is assessed for its validity and potential application to further survey work. The analysis of the Protocols alignment survey as a case study also offers insights about critical self-reflection and ways for non-Indigenous archivists to strive toward social justice and Protocols alignment using existing discovery and description frameworks as a starting point.

AB  - Creating information literate students and future employees is an expected outcome of a tertiary education. This paper shares insights from a successful collaboration between an academic and three university librarians to create an online learning module designed to develop students' professional information literacy capability: identifying business information types, searching online databases, and evaluating quality using a new indigenous-informed evaluation approach. Student learning was measured using reflective tasks and assessments. The paper challenges teachers and librarians to consider ways they can collaborate to explicitly embed information literacy (IL) skills development into large disciplinary courses, particularly during the transition into tertiary learning, to enhance lifelong learning capability and meet future workplace IL demands.

AB  - In response to varied needs from Education students, faculty and researchers, UBC librarians and library students repurposed problematic books from Indigenous children's literature collections into Critical Literacy Kits. By repackaging these problematic books, along with librarian-created learning materials and activity guides, these kits mediate access to problematic books and become a new tool for pedagogy. This article explores the intersection between critical literacy and the development of children's literature collections in academic libraries, proposing that the creation of kits like this increases the learning potential of problematic books, and prevents the erasure of critical engagement with these materials.

AB  - Collection development at Monash University Library aims to fulfil the research and curriculum needs of university staff and students. To support the Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture (MADA), collection development operates as a collaboration between academic faculty and the Subject Librarian. In order to further develop this collaboration and to encourage the selection and use of design resources by authors from diverse backgrounds, design lecturers and library staff have initiated The Equity Collection project. The aim of the project is to investigate the diversity of the collection in its current state and to improve its ability to reflect and extend the multicultural nature of the university community. The project includes a campaign to collect and promote books from the design world authored by under-represented groups, including Indigenous Australians, people of colour, and female and non-binary authors. This project is unique in its utilisation of the expertise of the design faculty who have extensive knowledge of authors, small publishers and less widely distributed publications.

AB  - Various international organisations such as the United Nations and the African Union recognise the value of language in development, peacebuilding and reconciliation. Language is also recognised in planning policies of countries such as South Africa where the National Development Plan of the country seeks to ensure that every citizen learns at least one African language by 2030. This paper sought to determine the availability, impact and visibility of African language material hosted by institutional repositories (IRs) at public universities in South Africa. Informetrics methods were applied using data obtained from DSpace, Google Scholar and ResearchGate to determine the impact and visibility. The most important findings were that 65.2 per cent of public university IRs had at least one African language document in their IRs. Overall, only 0.16 per cent of documents in public university IRs were in African languages. A total of 16 per cent of African language documents hosted by these IRs are in ResearchGate. This study appears to be the first to determine the visibility of African language documents hosted by IRs in South Africa in ResearchGate and their citation impact in Google. This study will add value to the literature on the role of academic libraries in preserving indigenous languages, knowledge, and culture. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose Many academic libraries use digital humanities projects to disseminate unique materials in their collections; during project planning, librarians will consider platforms, scanning rates and project sustainability. Rarely, though, will academic librarians consider how members from the communities that created the materials can contribute to digitization projects. The purpose of this study is to explain how collaboration with Zuni Pueblo (a Native American tribe in the southwest) community members improved a digital humanities project to disseminate Zuni language learning materials.Design/methodology/approach Methodologically relying on critical making, which involved community member feedback throughout the process, the Zuni Language Materials Collection will provide digital access to 35 language learning items.Findings The authors argue that collaboration with members of the community of creation dramatically improved item description, collection discoverability and collection interactivity. This study historicizes CONTENTdm and describes how the team modified this content management system to meet user needs. This project produced a prototype digital collection, collaboratively authored metadata and an interactive portal that invites users to engage with the collection.Practical implications Libraries continue to struggle to reach and reflect their diverse users. This study describes a process that others may use and modify to engage nearby Native American communities.Originality/value This piece shares a unique strategy of partnering with Native American community members on all aspects of digital humanities project development and design. This case study attempts to fill a gap in the literature as the first study to describe a digitization process using CONTENTdm with a Native American community. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Charles Darwin University Library is directly helping to sustain and preserve Aboriginal language and cultural materials that encounter many hurdles for their long-term survival. The library is supporting an ARC-funded project known as the Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages, by providing a repository, web application, digitisation programme and professional advice. The collaboration between the library and research team addressed a number of challenges in relation to appropriate ways to represent complex and variable metadata, widely varying content from diverse sources and in various conditions, and in making these fragile and endangered materials accessible to a global audience. The open access archive now includes thousands of items in dozens of Northern Territory Indigenous languages, providing a sustainable repository for researchers and allowing Indigenous communities to share their languages, histories, knowledge and practices around the world. The project serves as a rich case study demonstrating how academic libraries can work with researchers to support the archiving of cultural heritage. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The proposal of this article of theoretical nature is to analyze in the literature of the last five years, what is discussed about innovation in the context of university libraries. It was reserched in national and international databases from 2014 to 2018 articles related to this subject, as well as on innovation, in a general way. The objectives were to characterize the theories around the innovation process, to understand the evolution of the concept of innovation in different contexts of society and in Brazil, and to conclude with a review about the innovation process in the scope of information services, especially those offered in University Libraries. It is noticed that in Brazil, even the process being slow, the University Libraries are investing in new services focusing on the change of posture of its users. Many libraries, for example, already offer collaborative study spaces, in addition to the individual ones, establish vertical partnerships with information technology companies and cultural centers, in order to meet the current needs of the generation formed by digital natives.

AB  - Introduction: Indigenous peoples in Canada experience significant health challenges, but few pursue careers in the health sciences. Two programs by medical librarians designed to encourage children in First Nations communities to develop an interest in science and health and to dream of careers in the health professions will be presented. Description: An academic library in the province of Quebec developed children's health and science book collections with Indigenous school libraries. Library and information science students, as well as a librarian, participated in health education activities in the recipient schools. This project inspired the community service project of the joint MLA/CHLA-ABSC/ICLC Mosaic|Mosaïque 2016 conference, which focused on placing similar collections in Ontario Indigenous communities. The mechanics, benefits, and challenges of the programs will be discussed including book selection and delivery. Outcomes: Hundreds of books have been delivered and informal qualitative evaluative data from the recipient communities indicates that the programs have been very well received. Some difficulties in providing optimal access to the books were identified due to communication problems or the relative lack of library infrastructure in these communities. Discussion: Reading for pleasure is linked to student's academic success. Access to varied and quality literature is important for school achievement, therefore these collections may potentially impact student's future life chances. While a direct correlation between these collections and student's future career choices cannot be easily measured, it is known that Indigenous high school graduates frequently choose to pursue professions linked to the needs of the community. Therefore any materials drawing attention to potential community health needs or encouraging interest for health sciences may well influence students' choices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This research work focused on the mindset of librarians in the promotion of African Culture Vis - A - Vis Nigeria as a Nation. The culture of a people had been identified as the identity of such people. Taking a cursory look at Nigeria, as a nation in the continent of Africa, the invasion of European world had greatly influenced our ways of life. Libraries established by our colonial masters could not meet our indigenous needs. After independence, efforts were being made to enhance and promote our cultural values. The study unleashed the perception of librarians about our culture with Nigeria as a case study. The descriptive survey research design was adopted for the study. The population for the study consisted of forty - five (45) librarians purposively selected from three (3) university libraries in Nigeria; namely: Hezekiah Oluwasanmi Library, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile - Ife; Kenneth Dike Library, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, and the University of Lagos Library, Akoka, Lagos. These university libraries were selected because they are old institutions in the history of Nigeria and they contain resources on cultural artifacts from which generalization was made. Questionnaire was used as instrument for data gathering. Out of forty - Eight (48) questionnaires administered, forty - five (45) were returned valid. Data gathered were analyzed using simple frequency, percentages and four - point Lickert Scale of Strongly Agreed (SA), Agreed (A), Disagree (D), and Strongly Disagree (SD). A bench mark of 2.5 was set for the weighted mean from which conclusions were drawn. The result of the findings revealed the perception of Librarians about African culture. The roles they play in its promotion were also identified. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article focuses on the challenges and successes Stony Brook University Libraries' Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity Committee encountered from its inception in 2017 to the present. The formation of this committee was in response to a new university-wide program. A pool of more than 80 library personnel made quick and thoughtful decisions to determine the composition of the Committee. In the months that followed, members learned to navigate the challenges of goal setting, collaborating with others outside the library, funding, event planning, and marketing. One of the primary goals of the Committee was to initiate and maintain conversations and collaborations around equity, inclusion, and diversity. Efforts included the celebration of Native American heritage and culture, women's history, hip-hop history, and others. Another goal was to produce a meaningful and relevant mission to serve as a guide for our fledgling committee. The committee's efforts were inclusive of the communities both outside and inside of the library's sphere. Efforts were made to increase awareness and sensitivity among our library personnel via lectures, self-reflection workshops, and discussions. Further, committee members' attendance and participation at conferences and webinars provided many opportunities to engage in discussions with others who have started similar committees at their libraries.

AB  - In view of the importance of indigenous knowledge in development process, this paper investigated the efforts of selected federal university libraries in South West, Nigeria in indigenous knowledge collection development and preservation. The study adopted a descriptive survey design that involved the use structured questionnaire, unstructured interviews and observation as instruments for data collection. Seventy six (76) professional librarians constituted the target population of the study; therefore seventy six (76) copies of questionnaire were administered to the professional librarians in the selected university libraries. The data collected using the questionnaire complemented by interview and observation were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings from the study revealed the tremendous efforts of selected university libraries in IK collection development and preservation in the libraries as the study revealed the existence of IK materials. It also established that dearth of fund and linguistic problem were the challenges facing the collection development and preservation of IK in the selected university libraries. It therefore recommended that the university libraries should liaised with the international bodies for financial support for the sustainability of IK resources collection development and preservation in the libraries.

AB  - This research examines the experiences of librarians in Bluefields, Nicaragua. Semi-structured interviews and photovoice activities were used to investigate librarians’ professional development, daily operations, and ways of meeting the information needs of Costeños—or, Miskitu, Rama, and Sumu indigenous groups as well as African-descending Creoles. The findings suggest that librarians’ accounts coincide with established knowledge on Nicaragua's library landscape: libraries are predominantly formal and education-related; Nicaraguan society values oral knowledge or word-of-mouth information; and when compared with academic libraries, Nicaraguan public libraries are fewer and lack resources. Libraries on the Atlantic coast can strengthen their services through collaborations as well as culturally-based services. Additionally, the photovoice technique was found to be an effective tool for conducting research involving multicultural communities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective - This research project explored Native American students' perceptions of the Edmon Low Library at Oklahoma State University (OSU). The study sought to understand how Native American students perceived the role of the academic library in their lives, and which elements of the library students depicted and described as holding meaning for them. Methods - Photo-elicitation, a form of visual research and a participatory research method, was the primary method chosen to explore students' perceptions of the library. To qualify for this study, students self-identified as Native American and as frequent library users. They also had completed three or more semesters of study at OSU. Five students followed a photo prompt for taking at least fifteen pictures of the library, then participated in two separate interviews with the primary researcher. Participants also completed a demographic/questionnaire form, answered semi-structured questions, and ranked the photos they took. Results - This study produced several emergent findings. First, students expressed uncertainty about the library's books. Second, functional library tools such as express printers and library signage played a valuable role for facilitating student work. Third, the method of photoelicitation was enjoyable for students and served as library discovery. Fourth, Native American resources and exhibits in the library had varied salience for students. Conclusion - Limited research focuses on Native American students in academic libraries, particularly on how students use and experience the library. Exploring how individual students who identify as Native American perceive the university library enhanced our understanding of how libraries in Predominantly White Institutions (PWIs) can best serve and support students. This study provided insight into the method of photo-elicitation interviews. This research also provided practical benefits for student participants through increased library knowledge.

AB  - In libraries and archives, efforts to document underrepresented communities and diversify collections can be fraught with political tension. We explore an interdepartmental collaboration to create and preserve a digital collection documenting the Urban Native Relocation Program of the mid- to late-twentieth century in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Involving the Grand Valley State University Libraries, the Kutsche Office of Local History, and the university's Native American Advisory Board, the project serves as a model not just for collaborative collection development but also for community engagement and outreach. We find that process is as important as product in developing collaborative digital collections. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - INTRODUCTION Using a known platform to share content that is often overlooked by scholarly communication networks, The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) LibGuide from the University of New Mexico Libraries facilitates access to Native American perspectives on the #NODAPL movement through inclusion of social media content and primary source materials. This LibGuide highlights Native American voices and stories, content that is difficult for people outside Native American communities to find, and shares a different view of the protest movement absent from most mainstream media coverage. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT Rather than a comprehensive listing, a majority of the guide content comes from Native American media outlets and Native American-authored social media accounts instead of library resources behind paywalls. Mainstream and alternative media sources are included if authored by a Native American or if the source features a named individual sharing firsthand accounts. The DAPL LibGuide is the most viewed guide at UNM and was replicated at a small number of other academic libraries. NEXT STEPS Libraries can support the democratic process by highlighting similar types of community-created content shared outside of traditional scholarly communication networks, giving space to voices regularly disregarded. The DAPL guide may be considered, along with similar social justice and topical guides, as the beginning of a new model for information dissemination in libraries which reimagines the possibilities of the LibGuide resource.

AB  - Simple survival is the first condition for accessible and responsibly curated documents carrying Native voices. This article explores stewardship practices of an existing collection at the Washington State University Libraries, the Lucullus V. McWhorter Papers. McWhorter was an amateur historian and one of his most important cultural informants was his friend, author Christine Quintasket (Mourning Dove). This article considers the McWhorter Papers and the Quintasket materials from two disciplinary perspectives, those of an academic historian and a librarian and archivist. The authors represent their respective professional fields as they explore this case of highlighting tribal voices within a collection more broadly defined. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Purpose Academic libraries have long housed multimedia centers filled with digital media production equipment and software. All too frequently faculty members and students alike have assumed that this technology is the key to effective digital media. It is assumed that because our “digital native” students are constantly immersed in media, they can create effective media instinctively. But, being a prolific consumer of media does not necessarily intuit the capacity to be an effective producer of media, and informed communication skills are of greater importance than a student’s software knowledge. This paper aims to describe partnering with faculty on media assignment design, providing a media instruction and consultation program, and providing spaces and technologies specifically designed to support multimedia literacy.Design/methodology/approach This paper outlines programmatic and pedagogical strategies demonstrated to improve students’ acquisition of multimedia literacy skills. These strategies are based on the authors’ years of experience teaching and supporting multimedia literacy in the university curriculum and beyond. It concludes with a case study detailing a new program that leverages a library’s services in support of student creativity.Findings The paper outlines an eight-step workflow for media projects that is core to our multimedia literacy instruction program.Originality/value With digital literacy garnering renewed attention in higher education, academic libraries are ramping up their services in support of these goals. This paper focuses on strategies for deepening students’ media production competencies, rather than just teaching them software skills. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose The aim of this paper is to examine literature related to transfer students and students in transition through three interrelated lenses: student demographics and experiences, considerations encountered by institutions of higher education working to support these students and academic libraries’ interactions with this growing population.Design/methodology/approach Library and information science and education databases were searched for articles related to transfer student experiences and initiatives. Educational research and policy centers were also investigated for supplemental data and definitions.Findings Several key considerations for academic libraries interested in supporting transfer students emerged, including the growth and diversity of this population; academic, social and procedural experiences encountered during and after students’ transition; commonalities and differences with native first-year students; and the value of partnerships in fostering student success.Practical implications This review contextualizes conversations regarding transfer student experiences, providing a resource for librarians to understand this population from multiple perspectives and to use these perspectives to develop and enhance initiatives, resources and services.Originality/value Despite an increased emphasis on transfer students across higher education, there is little literature regarding libraries’ involvement with this population. This literature review also seeks to expand upon existing conversations by examining transfer student experiences beyond the library that could inform both their interactions with the library and the ways in which libraries connect and communicate with these students.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the information literacy proficiency of transfer students. This assessment of skills was undertaken to improve the services provided to transfer students in academic libraries, with a particular focus on information literacy instruction.Design/methodology/approach The Project Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy Skills (SAILS) test was administered to assess the information literacy proficiency of a cohort of undergraduate students taking courses on two regional campuses of a four-year institution. In total, 114 students participated, and SAILS test scores were compared to several demographic characteristics using one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).Findings Results showed that undergraduate students generally lack information literacy skills, even at the junior and senior levels. Previous library instruction had a positive impact on scores for two of the Association of College and Research Libraries information literacy standards, suggesting that library instruction programs can be effective at improving these skills. When examining performance across the board on the various information literacy skills, there was no significant difference between transfer and native students in this result set.Research limitations/implications This study had a limited sample size, and only tested students taking courses from two regional campus locations. Follow-up studies could broaden the scope to include main campus transfer students to form a larger sample size.Originality/value It was difficult to find original research within the library literature that directly addressed information literacy skills in a mixed population of transfer and native students. Further research in this area can serve to improve the services offered to all students within academic libraries. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper attempts to highlight the factors causing anxiety among non-native speakers of English when using academic library resources, services and facilities. This is crucial now that academic libraries worldwide are increasingly building up their collections of electronic journals and databases, which are predominantly in the English language. Findings from studies among non-native speakers of English reveal that they are susceptible to anxiety factors, which are rarely reported in studies in the native English-speaking countries. Some of these barriers include: insufficient resources, language, retrieval, lack of library skills, technology, network, environment and services, computer and physical comfort, and emotional barriers. A search was conducted to analyze the literature published in Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA) from 1986 until 2014 using the keyword 'library anxiety'. The sample selected was limited to literature on non-native speakers of English. The distinct anxiety-causing factors typically reported in these studies are recommended to be included in the library anxiety measure for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The focus of academic libraries has always on providing access to reliable information and indigenous scholarship via a website. In this regards, this paper aimed to explore the current status of the contents and features of academic library websites in Pakistan. Library Websites of 39 universities were studied by adopting a checklist procedures. The results of selected academic library websites' features and contents clearly show that the recent situation of these websites is not up to the mark and some have undeveloped web pages that do not guide the users much about the library services, resources, staff and library policies. In addition, majority of the library websites were missing imperative features like; updated contents, staff profile, users' account information, site map, help, geographical map and photo gallery services. Overall, very few library websites have been struggling to bridge the digital divide and represent the country academic and research profile. Some suggestions are presented, which can further develop the status of university library websites in Pakistan as well as in other developing countries. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: The main objective of this study is to find out the current way of preserving and disseminating information on indigenous medicine in Ghanaian university libraries. Methodology: The authors adopted the descriptive survey design, with the combination of purposive and simple random sampling technique to select the respondents. Para-professional and professional librarians and indigenous medicine practitioners were the major respondents. Two data collection instruments were used; namely questionnaire and interview. Quantitative data collected were analysed using simple tables with frequencies and percentages, while qualitative data were analysed thematically. Findings: Some of the findings are that apart from the Library of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology the remaining university libraries have little information resources on indigenous medicine since most of them have never thought of gathering documents on indigenous medicine. In addition, the study also indicated that some indigenous medicine practitioners want to keep to what they know, for fear of losing their intellectual property right others. Originally: Although a great deal has been written about the importance of knowledge management relatively little attention has been paid to how knowledge creation process of indigenous healthcare can be managed, hence the need for the university library which serves as a repository of knowledge transmission to assist in the dissemination of knowledge on indigenous medicine.

AB  - Princeton University Library's rare sixteenth-century polychrome Aztec picture map on deerskin vividly portrays the conversion of the Aztecs to Catholicism during the Early Colonial Period of the Spanish Conquest. A non-invasive technical examination was conducted to identify the colourants and the species of the animal hide support used in the creation of the map. Analysis included spectroscopic techniques such as attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Light microscopy and UVA fluorescence were also employed as tools. Results of the technical examination found the presence of cochineal, bone black, Maya blue, which are indigenous colourants traditionally associated with Mesoamerica, and a layer of an unknown greenish-yellow dye over Maya blue to create the colour green. The examination also discovered what appears to be an orange-yellow gamboge-like substance known as American (sometimes called Mexican) gamboge, which is indigenous to Mexico and parts of Central and South America. Its plant family is Hypericaceae, which is very closely related to Clusiaceae. Clusiaceae is the Southeast Asian and Indian plant family of gamboge, which is commonly used as a pigment in Western, Indian and Asian art. The study's exposure of the obscure substance may spur more research into its use as a colourant of the Mesoamerican palette. The paper also hopes to add to the overall knowledge of Mesoamerican materials in order to better understand aspects of their conservation and preservation. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Recherche spectroscopique non invasive sur une carte polychrome aztèque sur peau de daim du seizième siècle La rarissime carte polychrome aztèque sur peau de daim du XVIe siècle de la bibliothèque de l'Université de Princeton décrit avec éclat la conversion des Aztèques au catholicisme lors de la première période coloniale de la conquête espagnole. Un examen technique non invasif a été réalisé pour identifier les colorants et les espèces de peaux d'animaux utilisés pour la création de la carte. Les analyses comprenaient des techniques spectroscopiques telles que la réflectance totale atténuée-spectroscopie infrarouge a transformée de Fourier (FTIR) et la spectroscopie ultraviolette-visible. La microscopie optique et la fluorescence UVA ont également été utilisées comme outils d'observation. Les résultats de l'examen technique ont révélé la présence de cochenille, noir d'os, bleu maya, qui sont des colorants indigènes traditionnellement associés à la Mésoamérique, et une couche d'un colorant inconnu jaune verdâtre sur bleu maya pour créer la couleur verte. L'examen a également découvert ce qui semble être une substance proche de la gomme-gutte jaune-orange (ou jaune du Cambodge) connu sous le nom de gomme-gutte américaine (parfois appelée mexicaine), qui est indigène au Mexique et dans certaines parties de l'Amérique centrale et du sud. La gomme-gutte est de la famille des Hypéricacées, celle-ci étant très étroitement liée à la famille des Clusiaceae. Les Clusiaceae sont la famille de plantes du Cambodge du sud-est asiatique et indien couramment utilisé comme pigment dans l'art occidental, indien et asiatique. La révélation de l'étude de la substance sombre pourrait inciter davantage de recherches sur son utilisation comme colorant dans la palette mésoaméricaine. L'auteur de cet article espère aussi ajouter à la connaissance globale des matériaux mésoaméricains afin de mieux comprendre les problématiques liées à leur conservation et leur préservation.

AB  - Nicht-invasive Spektroskopische Untersuchungen einer polychromen aztekischen Karte auf Rehleder aus dem 16. Jahrhundert Die farbig ausgeführte aztekische Landkarte auf Rehleder aus dem 16. Jahrhundert wird in der Bibliothek der Princeton Universität aufbewahrt. Sie zeigt eine lebhafte Darstellung der Konvertierung von Azteken zum Katholizismus in der Frühzeit der Spanischen Eroberung. Um die Farbstoffe und die für die Anfertigung der Landkarte verwendete Tierhaut zu identifizieren, wurde eine nicht-invasive technologische Untersuchung durchgeführt. Analysemethoden umfassten dabei spektroskopische Techniken wie Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrarot Spektroskopie (ATR-FTIR) und UV-Vis Spektroskopie sowie Lichtmikroskopie und UVA-Fluoreszenz. Es konnte die Anwesenheit von traditionell in Mesoamerika verwendeten Farbmitteln wie Cochenille, Knochenschwarz und Maya-blau nachgewiesen werden; weiters wurde ein unbekannter grünlich-gelber Farbstoff entdeckt, der über dem Maya-blau lag und einen grünen Farbton ergab. Auch eine orange-gelbe, Gummigutt artige Substanz wurde identifiziert, die als Amerikanischer (manchmal auch Mexikanischer) Gummigutt bekannt ist, der in Mexiko und Teilen von Zentral- und Südamerika heimisch ist. Er zählt zur Pflanzenfamilie der Hypericaceae, die nahe mit der Familie der Clusiaceae verwandt ist. Clusiaceae ist eine südostasiatische und indische Pflanzenfamilie von Gummigutt, die in westlicher, indischer und asiatischer Kunst oft Verwendung fand. Es bedarf weiterer Untersuchungen zur Verwendung der in dieser Studie entdeckten unbekannten, orange-gelben Substanz als Farbmittel der mesoamerikanischen Palette. Ziel dieses Beitrags ist es, zum allgemeinen Wissen über die in mesoamerikanischer Kunst verwendeten Materialien beizutragen, um auch Aspekte ihrer Erhaltung besser zu verstehen.

AB  - Objective - This research project explored the models of Indigenous support programs in Australian academic libraries, and how they align with the needs of the students they support. The research objective was to gather feedback from Indigenous students and obtain evidence of good practice models from Australian academic libraries to inform the development and enhancement of Indigenous support programs. The research presents the viewpoints of both Indigenous students and librarians. Methods - The research methods comprised an online survey using SurveyMonkey and a focus group. The survey was conducted nationally in Australia to gather evidence on the different models of Indigenous support provided by academic libraries. The survey explored the nature of support services such as specialized study spaces and resources, information literacy education, and liaison services for Indigenous students. The survey also asked respondents to comment on the challenges they encountered and improvements they would recommend in providing Indigenous student support. To provide a student perspective, a small cohort of Indigenous students at a small university in South East Queensland was interviewed in a focus group about their library experiences. The focus group explored Indigenous students' perceptions of the library, their frequency of use and where they gofor help with their studies. Results - The survey found that 84% of academic libraries provide some specific support for Indigenous students with 89% of those support services being conducted in a place other than the library. Across the sector, Australian academic libraries have a strong commitment to the success of Indigenous students and considerable engagement with Indigenous issues. The focus group found that Indigenous students' needs and concerns about using the library were not differentiated by their cultural background. Rather their concerns were similar to issues being raised in the broader student population. Conclusion - The survey results indicated that the main areas in which support for Indigenous students might be improved are greater inter-departmental communication and collaboration within the university, increased training of library staff in Indigenous cultural sensitivity, and the employment of Indigenous library staff members. The focus group was valuable in opening the communication channels between Indigenous students and library staff and highlighted the importance of engaging with students using both formal and informal channels.

AB  - The Personal Librarian for Aboriginal Students (PLAS) program at the University of Alberta (Uof A) is a creative outgrowth of the growing Personal Librarian programs in academic libraries, in which a student is partnered with an individual librarian for the academic year. In the case of the UofA's PLAS program, first-year undergraduate students who self-identified as Aboriginal during the registration process were selected as participants. The first year of the program saw many successes. This paper provides background on the initiative and the associated action research indicating a creative approach to engaging Aboriginal students.

AB  - Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is being increasingly implemented in academic libraries due to a promise of increased collections management efficiency. This paper reports on the recent implementation of RFID technology in the library at the University of Technology Sydney, providing insights into the change management process of RFID implementation. The paper focuses on the implications of the implementation and indigenisation of RFID technology for three specific and symbiotic areas of the library: people, processes and technology. Data from interviews with eight participants involved at various levels of the academic library were collected. This paper develops a best practice model through the insights gained by the people involved in the RFID implementation. The case study posits the dynamic relationships between people, processes and technology as greatly impacted by the implementation process, and analyses the divergence between projected and actual outcomes in the implementation process.

AB  - This study examines racial and ethnic diversity among Canadian academic librarians and discusses the findings of a nationwide survey. The survey posed questions related to equity plans and programs as well as recruitment practices for academic librarians from equity-seeking groups with a focus on Aboriginal and visible/racial minority librarians. It explored the needs and experiences of Aboriginal and visible/racial minority librarians employed in Canadian academic libraries by examining questions of organizational climate, mentoring, institutional support, advancement opportunities, and the roles of library associations. The findings reveal a need for more diversity awareness and training and leadership with respect to diversity on the part of academic libraries and the profession at large in Canada.

AB  - Technology lending has proven to be one of the most popular services that the Ryerson University Library and Archives (RULA) has offered in the past few years. Given the number of commuting digital natives comprising our student body, the library wanted to know how these students were using our current laptop loan program and how this service could evolve to better serve their academic learning needs. Using a mixed methodology including focus groups, interviews, and a comprehensive survey, this study sought to discover options to further improve this program. Could we develop the program by customizing the laptop into a unique learning and research tool? Could we insert the library into the laptops to better assist our students along their academic journey? [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
